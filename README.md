# syncview
## Overview
The rough basis of a blender AddOn, intended to provide an easy way to navigate a side-by-side stereoscopic setup.
The user can pan and zoom synchronously between two 3dViews. It turns blender into a basic photogrammetric workstation if one can provide:
- a couple of oriented and georeferenced cameras e.g. issued from [MicMac](https://github.com/micmacIGN/micmac),
- and a set of georeferenced data handled with [Blender GIS](https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS).
